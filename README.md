Available on NPM and bower under name `self-addressed`.

Provides single function `stamp(mailman, address, data)`, that returns a Promise.

## Example

```js
var stamp = require('self-addressed');
var mailman = function (address, envelope) {
    address.postMessage(envelope, '*');
};
stamp(mailman, window, { foo: 'foo' })
    .then(function (response) {
        console.log('got response to our letter', response);
    });
```

## Api

Single function `selfAddressed` can do 3 things at once

* `selfAddressed(mailman, address, data)` - can deliver data via `mailman` to `address` and then
returns a promise that resolves with response.
* `selfAddressed(envelope, letter)` - puts `letter` into valid `enveloper` to be delivered back as 
a response.
* `selfAddressed(envelope)` - returns either the letter stored in the `envelope` or `undefined` if this
is an invalid envelope.

### Extras

You can see verbose log messages by setting `selfAddressed.options.verbose = true;`

## Typical workflow

**iframed page.html** that wants to communicate with the parent can `postMessage` and receive a reply

```js
function mailman(address, msg) {
  address.postMessage(msg, '*');
}
window.onmessage = function (event) {
  selfAddressed(event.data);
};
selfAddressed(mailman, parent, 'foo')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response); // "bar"
  });
```

**index page** that iframes `page.html` inside and uses `onmessage` to open the envelope,
place new letter inside and send the response back to the source.

```js
function mailman(address, msg) {
  address.postMessage(msg, '*');
}
window.onmessage = function (event) {
  var letter = selfAddressed(event.data);
  // if letter === undefined => not an envelope, handle differently!
  var returnAddress = event.source;
  selfAddressed(event.data, 'bar'); // places the letter into the same envelope
  selfAddressed(mailman, returnAddress, event.data);
};
```

## Combined with other data

Often we have other sources of data to be handled inside `onmessage` callback.
One can ask if the received data is self-addressed to determine if it has been handled
by `self-addressed` or not using `selfAddressed.is(envelope)`.

```js
window.onmessage = function (event) {
  // event could be self-addressed envelope or not
  if (selfAddressed.is(event.data)) {
    var letter = selfAddressed(event.data);
    if (!letter) {
      // nothing to do - it has been handled via promise resolution
    } else {
      // handle letter, maybe reseal and send response?
    }
  } else {
    // not an envelope - handle yourself
  }
}
```
